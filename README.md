# Software Engineering | Medical Insurance Price Prediction
College Course where my team worked on using Machine Learning algorithms to develop a GUI that allowed users to get Medical Insurnace Premium estimates, based off the information in the organized csv file they provide (example csv included).

**Included in this repository is:**
* Example csv file
* PDF document of the entire project (INCLUDES MANUAL)
* Python Notebook with the functions and main code for the ML algorithms
* Py file for the GUI creation
